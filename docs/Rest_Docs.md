If the user is not logged in: user can go about the study_set endpoints, but homepage has no endpoints. 


The first time the user clicks the “Sign In” button in our homepage , we go through the Google Sign-On process, and redirect the user to the page where they enter university, username (NON_MVP-->and can optionally make their bio).  This info will be sent to this endpoint (/users/) to create an entry in the Users Info entity.
/users/ → POST request (body attr: username, university, bio) → NON-MVP-->bio can be initialized as null.
`{
	status_code: #,
}`


But if the user is automatically logged in(you can get the id → and like save it in the JS file) and , you redirect them to the dashboard html page and to populate that page we use this endpoint (/users/#id).
Dashboard.html calls -->/users/id#
/users and /users/“id” modeled after  https://api.github.com/users/“username” → GET request
`{
	id : #,
email: “ ”,
name: “ ”,
username: “ ”,
university: “ ”,
study_sets_url: [ “ ” ],
bio: “ ”;
verified_status: bool,
profile_url: “ ”
}`
Creating Study Set which is a post request

/study_set → POST request (body param: Collection(of cards front/back), title, description, and subject)
`{
          Status_code: # (tells if the request was successful)
}`
